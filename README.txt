This code is from my Dissertation in 2005.

I thought it would be an interesting experiment to take some of the oldest code that I still have and apply the concepts I've learnt form Robert Martin's book, Clean Code. 
Expect much refactoring as the codebase evolves.

The program requires a Java IDE to run it. Tested in Eclipse Galieleo. Once you've pulled down the code, create a new project, and point to source to the files. You will need to run the GUI class.

Abstract:
The goal of the project is to produce a program of the turn-based board game Battleships, where a human user plays against an Artificial Intelligence agent.
The report accompanying the project includes research into various Artificial Intelligence techniques used in other programs of turn-based board games and a decision on which Artificial Intelligence technique(s) to use in this project.
The design and testing used to complete the project will also be included
