This code is from my Dissertation in 2005.

I thought it would be an interesting experiment to take some of the oldest code that I still have and apply the concepts I've learnt from <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0132350882/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE'> Robert Martin's book, Clean Code</a>.

Expect much refactoring as the codebase evolves and SOLID principles are applied to code which was written without knowledge of design patterns

The program requires a Java IDE to run it, I've been using Eclipse Galileo. Once you've pulled down the code, create a new project, and set the source to these files. You will need to run the BattleShipEngine class.

Abstract:
The goal of the project is to produce a program of the turn-based board game Battleships, where a human user plays against an Artificial Intelligence agent.
The report accompanying the project includes research into various Artificial Intelligence techniques used in other programs of turn-based board games and a decision on which Artificial Intelligence technique(s) to use in this project.
The design and testing used to complete the project will also be included
